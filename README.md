Ship
====

Ship is top scrolling arcade style game written in HTML5/Javascript.

It takes an XML "mod file" and a canvas element as input. The mod file
describes the enemies, weapons, images and sounds that should make up
the game. Ship.js then generates a playable game level in the canvas
based on simple provided generation parameters.
